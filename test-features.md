## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Equipment Lifecycle
1. Admin adds equipment requiring approval
2. Student requests equipment
3. Manager gives initial approval
4. Admin gives final approval
5. Student uses equipment (shows "taken until" date)
6. Student returns early via early return modal
7. Generate PDF report showing the complete lifecycle

### Scenario 2: Role-Based Access
1. Create users with different roles (student, teacher, manager, admin)
2. Test access to different features based on role
3. Verify manager can access approval workflows
4. Verify students can only see their own requests and early return option

### Scenario 3: PDF Export Testing
1. Generate inventory report as PDF
2. Generate usage report as PDF
3. Generate requests report as PDF
4. Verify all data is properly formatted in PDF

## 🔧 Quick Setup Commands

```bash
# Start the system
cd backend && npm start
cd frontend && npm run dev
