School Inventory Management System
Project Overview
School staff and students rely on a variety of equipment and materials for a productive learning
environment. From projectors and monitors to USB drives and stationery, managing these assets can be
time-consuming for teachers and administrators. This system provides a digital solution for school users
and administrators to effectively manage and monitor classroom equipment, supplies, and materials.
Main Capabilities:
• Users can request and track equipment usage.
• Admins can manage inventory, handle approvals, and generate reports.
